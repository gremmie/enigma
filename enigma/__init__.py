"""This package is a simulation of the wartime Enigma Machines used by the
German military branches. These include the army (Wehrmacht), air force
(Luftwaffe), and navy (Kriegsmarine). For our purposes, the Wehrmacht and
Luftwaffe versions are identical. The Kriegsmarine models M3 and M4 can be
simulated by configuring an EnigmaMachine object with the suitable rotors.

For a list of the rotors and reflectors we simulate, see the module rotors.data.
