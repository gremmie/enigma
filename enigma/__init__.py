"""This package is a simulation of the Enigma Machines used by the German armed
forces (Wehrmacht) during World War II. These include the army (Heer), air force
(Luftwaffe), and navy (Kriegsmarine). For our purposes, the Heer and Luftwaffe
versions are identical. The Kriegsmarine models M3 and M4 can be simulated by
configuring an EnigmaMachine object with the suitable rotors and reflectors.

For a list of the rotors and reflectors we simulate, see the module rotors.data.
